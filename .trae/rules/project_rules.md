# Project Rules

## File Modification Protocol
- **Always read the entire file** before making any changes
- **Understand the existing structure and logic** completely before editing
- **Check for consistency** with the project's current patterns and conventions
- **Never make blind changes** - ensure modifications align with what's already there
- **Check for running servers** - always verify that the frontend and backend processes are not already running in your terminal before starting new instances.
- **Preserve existing functionality** unless explicitly instructed to change it
- **Test thoroughly** after making changes to ensure they don't break existing features
- **Document any significant changes** in the file or accompanying comments
